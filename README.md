# How to use this keyboard [üîº](#contents)
- By default the keyboard has 4 Layers, when you just turn on the keyboard, the keyboard is at layer0-the QWERTY layer.  
- When you tap or hold the ```SYM``` key, the keyboard will enter layer1, and the keyboard backlight will start blinking, you can type numbers or symbols at this layer.  
- When you tap or hold the ```aA``` key at the lower right corner, the keyboard will enter layer2 and the keyboard backlight will do a loop effect, you can type some symbols and do some Bluetooth behaviors at this layer.
- The layer 3 basically has no keycode, this layer is reserved for the customer, and the keyboard will blink the twice speed as the layer 1.  


**Now let's check the keymap.**  
## Keymap [üîº](#contents)
**Layer0-QWERTY**    
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7bf9b876-41b6-4618-8528-f4447dbfe77d" width="100%" alt="9981_PRO_layer0">
</p>

> [!NOTE]
> - **What means sticky ctrl?** If you want to copy something, you can tap Ctrl and then tap C, the keyboard will triger Ctrl+C, you can do that with one hand.  
> - **What means sticky layer?** A sticky layer stays pressed until another key is pressed. Example: when you short type sym key, the keyboard will enter sticky layer1 after you type the "B" key, the keyboard will type "!" and return to layer0, it's easier to type with one hand.  
> - **What means lock layer?** The "lock layer" behavior enables a layer while a certain key is pressed. Example: when you want to type many numbers you can hold the sym key and tap "WER" and the keyboard will type "123", when you release the sym key, the keyboard will return to layer 0.  
> - **What means to layer?** By default when you double tap the dollar key, the keyboard will go to layer 1, then you can type numbers without pressing the sym key, you need to manually return to layer0 by tap the sym key at layer1.  

**Layer1-Numbers and symbols**

</p>
 
**Layer2-Functional keys**   
<p align="center">

</p>

> [!NOTE]
> - **What does Eject key do?** When you press E at layer 2, the keyboard will type Eject, Eject can ```bring up``` or ```disable``` keyboard on screen on iphone, this key is important because on iphone by default the keyboard on screen is disable when iphone is connected withe external keyboard.
> - Double tap the trackpad on this layer which trigger the ```Clear bluetooth pairing``` is very important to pair with another device more info please check the content [How to connect this keyboard with your device](How-to-connect-this-keyboard-with-your-device-)
> - This Layer contains many important keycode about Bluetooth connect and Multiconnect, more info please check

**Layer3-Reserved layer for extra keys**

</p>

> [!NOTE]
> - You enter Layer 3 by double tap dollar key at layer 1, you can customize how to enter this layer yourself by editting the keymap.  
> - You can set some key at this layer as Media key like ```next song``` or ```pause``` which I think should be useful.

## <a name='Realtime Keymap Updating  '>Realtime Keymap Updating   </a>
[ZMK Studio](https://zmk.dev/docs/features/studio) provides runtime update functionality to ZMK powered devices, allowing users to change their keymap layers without flashing new firmware to their keyboards.  

You can use ZMK Studio with ```Chrome/Edge``` at [https://zmk.studio/](https://zmk.studio/).  

Before you use ZMK Studio, you need to ```turn off``` the bluetooth from your phone that the keyboard is paired with, then you can select the port shown on the ZMK Studio page and then start the keymap updating.  

The picture below shows you how it looks like when the keyboard connects with ZMK Studio successfully.

> [!NOTE]
> Currently The ZMK Studio is still beta version, there are some functions that ```can not``` be configured e.g. macro, 
> there is another advanced way to update the keymap, please check the content below

0. Register a Github account if you don't have one
1. Access the zmk firmware [github page](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk)  
2. Create a codespace by clicking this icon:
